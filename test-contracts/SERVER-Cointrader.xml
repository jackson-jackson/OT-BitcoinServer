  Disbursements from the Mint account are to be made on receipt of
  duly signed and public authorization from the Issuer.  All
  disbursements from the Mint account are to be made to the single
  Currency Comptroller account identified by the authorization.

  From time to time, the Currency Comptroller may direct the
  Currency Manager to return digital assets to the Mint
  for the express purpose of reducing the float. Digital assets
  so delivered are to be deposited into the Mint account,
  thus reducing the float by that amount.
